            About Fox Day
        </h2>
        <p>
            Fox Day is an annual tradition established by Rollins' 10th president, Hugh McKean, in 1956. 
            Each spring, the President cancels all classes, providing students with a surprise day off. 
            A statue of the Rollins fox appears on the Mills lawn early in the morning, 
            and the Chapel bells ring to alert students, many of whom immediately head for the beach. 
            The three-foot-high, 300-pound statue, with his knowing air, the hint of a smirk playing at his lips, 
            contemplates the campus all day, watching students, faculty and staff enjoy their brief respite.
